The AI engineer's work, as described in the trajectory, primarily focused on iterative UI/UX enhancements for the Kaggi application's dealer dashboard. Initially, the work involved extensive styling adjustments using TailwindCSS, implementing Nettbil-inspired layouts, integrating bid functionality, and ensuring bilingual support by correcting Norwegian text in Icelandic/English translations. A recent significant task was transitioning from borders to subtle shadows for content blocks, which was ongoing.

The latest interaction saw the user explicitly request a specific UI modification: changing the Opna uppboð (Open Auction) buttons from orange to blue. The AI engineer successfully located the relevant button in  by cross-referencing UI text with i18n translations and TailwindCSS classes. It accurately identified the target button, distinguishing it from other orange buttons, and applied the  class. The change was verified with a screenshot, confirming the button's color update while retaining its styling.

The Kaggi application features a car owner's valuation dashboard and a dealer dashboard. The dealer dashboard () underwent a significant UI/UX overhaul to enhance usability, drawing inspiration from Nettbil. This included adopting the 's header/footer, incorporating logout, a compact search bar, and a left sidebar with dynamic sections (Active auctions, Coming cars, My bids, Favorites, My purchases). Visual improvements involved removing sidebar borders, adding a header shadow, consistent gray backgrounds, removing FAQs and count circles, increasing font sizes, and adjusting padding. Auction Flash cards display a preview (image, type/year, kilometers, highest bid) with a dynamic, diagonal status ribbon. The auction detail view required a horizontally smaller image gallery, a Nettbil-style status and bidding column, full bilingual support (Icelandic/English), and a taller main image (). The Boðsaga (Bid History) section was moved below the Status column, in a distinct white box. Recent updates focused on separating Status and Boðsaga into distinct white boxes, correcting internationalized text, implementing Nettbil-style buttons (peachy/coral, rounded/pill-shaped, side-by-side bid buttons, specific increment amounts), underlining the What is auto bid? link, ensuring bid buttons are equally sized, and replacing borders around main content blocks with shadows. The latest explicit request was to change the Opna uppboð buttons from orange to blue.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing two primary aspects of the dealer dashboard UI. Initially, the work focused on a comprehensive visual refinement where the user requested removing existing  styling and replacing it with  classes for the main content blocks: Image Gallery, Car Details, Status, and Bid History within . This task was concluding with a verification screenshot.

The most recent and successfully completed task involved a user-requested color change for specific buttons. The user explicitly asked to change the Opna uppboð (Open Auction) buttons on the dealer dashboard from orange to blue. The AI engineer performed the following actions:
1.  Identified the  translation key in .
2.  Located the specific Opna uppboð button element in  around line 995.
3.  Changed its styling from  (peachy/coral) to .
4.  Verified this change by taking a screenshot of the  page, confirming that the button now appears blue while retaining its rounded, pill-shaped design and other associated styling. The Place bid button (line 731) correctly remained orange as per the user's implicit intent.
